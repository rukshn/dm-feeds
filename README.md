RSS is a great way to get content and read without any distractions.

Unfortunately most publications now opt in not to include an RSS feed for their websites.

This project amis to create an RSS feeds for websites that I love to consume content but don't offer an RSS feed.

And people like me and others can consume content thought their favorite RSS readers without distractions.

I intends to support both ATOM and RSS protocols.

## Currenly supporting

- DailyMirror - dailymirror.lk

## Planning to support

- FT.lk

## Support the project

The content is currenly being scrapped via a python script and served via a Flask web server.

You can support the project by,

- Creating an RSS feed for a website you love and making a pull request, so that I can make a merge

- Fix any bugs that your might come across

- Spreading the word
